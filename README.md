The "Fit Zone (GYM)" project is a web application developed with Flask that manages gym clients. 
It uses a PostgreSQL database to store customer information, and Flask-Migrate to handle database migrations. 
The forms are implemented using Flask-WTF, and the interface design is styled with Bootstrap. 
The project includes paths to view, edit, and add clients, and uses HTML templates to render these actions.
